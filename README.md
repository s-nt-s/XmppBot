The XmppBot framework is powered by [Slixmpp](https://slixmpp.readthedocs.io/)
and allows you to easily write bots that use the XMPP protocol.
You can create commands by decorating functions in your subclass
or customize the botâ€™s operation completely. MUCs are also supported.

You can see some examples in [`examples` folder](https://github.com/s-nt-s/XmppBot/tree/master/examples).

You can install and unsintall with:

```
# install
pip3 install slixmppbot
# uninstall
pip3 uninstall slixmppbot
```
